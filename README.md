# theCBook
The C Book is a book about C.  
Mike Banahan,  Declan Brady, Mark Doran  
January 1991  

This repository implements the different exercices.  
All implementations are made on my own without any other documentation and for sure are perfectible.  
I try to code considering the state of knowledge available at the point of the book where the exercise is given.
